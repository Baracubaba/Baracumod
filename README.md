# Baracumod
**Luiz-AVcruz Mod Idea for Baracubaba**

## Overview
This Minecraft mod project primarily utilizes [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), with the support of the [Kotlin for Forge library](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kotlin-for-forge). The scarcity of modding resources in Kotlin has led me to convert everything myself. My aim is not only to create an engaging mod but also to provide a comprehensive educational resource. Through detailed documentation, this mod is intended to simplify the Minecraft modding journey and to encourage the use of Kotlin in Minecraft mod development.

## Goals
- **Educational Approach:** Even if this mod isn't the most exciting, it aims to be an excellent learning resource for creating Minecraft mods.
- **Advocating Kotlin:** Promote the use of Kotlin for Minecraft mod development, highlighting its advantages over Java.
- **Detailed Roadmap and Wiki:** Provide a [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/r?id=656dbfc65145316d25b5a6da) and wiki detailing mod development in both Java and Kotlin.
- **Documenting Challenges:** Record all my impediments and steps to create a realistic tutorial of my initial journey in the wiki.

## Upcoming Plans
- **Completing the Kotlin Tutorial:** Finish the tutorial with everything converted to Kotlin, guided by [Kaupenjoe's](https://www.youtube.com/@ModdingByKaupenjoe) excellent Java material.
- **Establishing a Standard for New Kotlin Projects:** Work towards setting a standard for new projects developed in Kotlin.
- **Detailed README:** A Standard structured and informative README will be developed soon to provide clearer context and guidance for this project.

_Stay tuned for more updates and detailed documentation to facilitate your Minecraft modding experience in Kotlin._
